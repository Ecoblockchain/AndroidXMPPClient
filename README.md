Creating an XMPP Client for Android devices to connect with an XMPP server

A complete explanation of how to connect an XMPP Android Client to a local XMPP Server is provided at
http://im-a-developer-too.blogspot.ca/2014/04/creating-android-xmpp-client-using.html

My goal is to create an oprn source XMPP client for Android where 
1) connect to a XMPP server, add new users 
2) provide a nice friends list 
3) interractive UI
4) able to store chat history or disabling it

Any contribution is greatly appreciated.
